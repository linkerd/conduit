## v0.2.0

This is a big milestone! With this release, Conduit adds support for HTTP/1.x and raw TCP traffic,
meaning it should "just work" for most applications that are running on Kubernetes without
additional configuration.

* Data plane
  * Conduit now transparently proxies all TCP traffic, including HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2.
    (See caveats below.)
* Command-line interface
  * Improved error handling for the `tap` command
  * `tap` also now works with HTTP/1.x traffic
* Dashboard
  * Minor UI appearance tweaks
  * Deployments now searchable from the dashboard sidebar

Caveats:
* Conduit will automatically work for most protocols. However, applications that use WebSockets,
  HTTP tunneling/proxying, or protocols such as MySQL and SMTP, will require some additional
  configuration. See the [documentation](https://conduit.io/adding-your-service/#protocol-support)
  for details.
* Conduit doesn't yet support external DNS lookups. These will be addressed in an upcoming release.
* There are known issues with Conduit's telemetry pipeline that prevent it from scaling beyond a
  few nodes. These will be addressed in an upcoming release.
* Conduit is still in alpha! Please help us by
  [filing issues and contributing pull requests](https://github.com/runconduit/conduit/issues/new).


## v0.1.3

* This is a minor bugfix for some web dashboard UI elements that were not rendering correctly.

## v0.1.2

Conduit 0.1.2 continues down the path of increasing usability and improving debugging and
introspection of the service mesh itself.

* Conduit CLI
  * New `conduit check` command reports on the health of your Conduit installation.
  * New `conduit completion` command provides shell completion.
* Dashboard
  * Added per-path metrics to the deployment detail pages.
  * Added animations to line graphs indicating server activity.
  * More descriptive CSS variable names. (Thanks @natemurthy!)
  * A variety of other minor UI bugfixes and improvements
* Fixes
  * Fixed Prometheus config when using RBAC. (Thanks @FaKod!)
  * Fixed `tap` failure when pods do not belong to a deployment. (Thanks @FaKod!)

## v0.1.1

Conduit 0.1.1 is focused on making it easier to get started with Conduit.

* Conduit can now be installed on Kubernetes clusters that use RBAC.
* The `conduit inject` command now supports a `--skip-outbound-ports` flag that directs Conduit to
  bypass proxying for specific outbound ports, making Conduit easier to use with non-gRPC or HTTP/2
  protocols.
* The `conduit tap` command output has been reformatted to be line-oriented, making it easier to
  parse with common UNIX command line utilities.
* Conduit now supports routing of non-fully qualified domain names.
* The web UI has improved support for large deployments and deployments that don't have any
  inbound/outbound traffic.

## v0.1.0

Conduit 0.1.0 is the first public release of Conduit.

* This release supports services that communicate via gRPC only. non-gRPC HTTP/2 services should
  work. More complete HTTP support, including HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 and non-gRPC HTTP/2, will be
  added in an upcoming release.
* Kubernetes 1.8.0 or later is required.
* kubectl 1.8.0 or later is required. `conduit dashboard` will not work with earlier versions of
  kubectl.
* When deploying to Minikube, Minikube 0.23 or 0.24.1 or later are required. Earlier versions will
  not work.
* This release has been tested using Google Kubernetes Engine and Minikube. Upcoming releases will
  be tested on additional providers too.
* Configuration settings and protocols are not stable yet.
* Services written in Go must use grpc-go 1.3 or later to avoid
  [grpc-go bug #1120](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/issues/1120).
